The Jacuzzi Notification Simulator Project - Useful for applications that generate a lot of emails and SMS messages. This project accepts SMS from such applications over a HTTP GET request and stores them in its own database. It then provides APIs to retrieve the messages for a given mobile number. A small compact GUI is also available where you search for a list of messages given a mobile number.
